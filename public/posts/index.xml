      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about starting some kind of blog/website for a while. My first website came in the form of a Freewebs (remember that?) site where I mainly posted embedded links to my favorite YouTube videos and Flash games at around age 9. Child me understood the joys of shouting into the void.
So why is it that I, with a hard drive full of music, an assortment of hobbies, a plethora of (arguably bad) opinions, and a computer science degree don&amp;rsquo;t have a website now?</description>
