## It's time.
I've thought about starting some kind of blog/website for a while. My first website came in the form of a Freewebs (remember that?)
site where I mainly posted embedded links to my favorite YouTube videos and Flash games at around age 9. Child me understood the
joys of shouting into the void.

So why is it that I, with a hard drive full of music, an assortment of hobbies, a plethora of (arguably bad) opinions, and a
computer science degree don't have a website now?

*I...don't know exactly.*

So now, I suppose, it's time.

As of the time of writing, this website is being hosted on Github Pages and built using the static website generator Hugo. I 
*haaaaaaaate* writing HTML for reasons I do not fully understand (I think it's because angle brackets scare me), so being able 
to spew out ideas in Markdown then have them regurgitated onto a blog with prettier CSS than I would ever have the patience to 
design myself sounds like an easy enough time.

If you're reading this, then that means I have succeeded in at least that.

## Why "A Mess Of Cables"?
Good question. It's because I possess a mess of cables. Between all my computer doodads and retro video game consoles and, mainly,
music gear, I have amassed a mess of cables. I have been using this name when releasing music for my friends (and hopefully
in the future myself), but I figured it ties together both my love for computers and music, so if there was going to be a name
for this website, it had to be that.

I will be posting a lot of music on here...hopefully. I've still got to learn how to embed audio files on this site, which from an
initial glance seems not very difficult (thank you Hugo devs!) But as of now, my idea for this website is to simply be the void
with which I scream into. Maybe one day I'll end up on Hacker News like the rest of you cool cats. Or maybe nobody will ever read
this initial post.

I don't care. It's my void and I will do with it as I please.
